infuse/libs
===========

infuse/libs provide a jumping off point for web development, inspired by express.js (amongst others). The libraries are meant to be consumed à la carte. You will find few dependencies here, even amongst various classes. These libraries have been used in the battlefield in projects both small and large. There is even a framework built around these libraries.

## Infuse Framework

An MVC framework, called Infuse Framework, has been built using these libraries. Check it out at [https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse).
