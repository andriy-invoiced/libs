*infuse/libs* is a set of libraries designed for rapid PHP development.

These libraries are unit-tested, battle-tested, and can be used à la carte. Each class has as few external dependencies as possible. Inspiration was drawn from many sources, in particular, the simplicity of node libraries like express.js.

## Idealist Framework

An MVC framework, called Idealist Framework, has been built using *infuse/libs*. Check it out at [https://github.com/idealistsoft/framework](https://github.com/idealistsoft/framework).

## Tests

Use phpunit to run the included tests (more tests coming later):

```
phpunit
```

## Requirements

- PHP 5.4+
