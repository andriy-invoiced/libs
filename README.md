infuse/libs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaredtking/infuse-libs.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaredtking/infuse-libs)
===========

*infuse/libs* is a set of libraries designed for rapid PHP development of single-page apps, giant monolithic projects, and everything in-between. There is even a [framework](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse) built around *infuse/libs*.

The simplified syntax was inspired by express.js. These libraries are unit-tested, battle-tested, and can be used à la carte. Depending on the class, there will be few to no external dependencies.

## Infuse Framework

An MVC framework, called Infuse Framework, has been built using *infuse/libs*. Check it out at [https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse).

## Tests

Use phpunit to run the included tests (more tests coming later):

```
