infuse/libs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaredtking/infuse-libs.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaredtking/infuse-libs)
===========

*infuse/libs* is a set of libraries designed to speed up PHP development for single-page apps, huge monolithic projects, and everything in-between. With simplified syntax inspired by express.js, the libraries can be used à la carte.

These libraries are unit-tested and battle-tested. There is even a [framework](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse) built around *infuse/libs*. Depending on the class, there will be few to no external dependencies. 

## Infuse Framework

An MVC framework, called Infuse Framework, has been built using *infuse/libs*. Check it out at [https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse).

## Tests

Use phpunit to run the included tests (more tests coming later):
